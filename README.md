## Installation
- Download the latest release from the Releases Page

## Functionality
- Pressing `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q` activates the Application
- Contents of User's Clipboard are presented one-word at a time, based on User's desired WPS rate.
- Pressing the Bottom Right Button reveals a Color Picker and User may choose the color for highlighting the text

## Extra
I have nothing to plug here. But here's a quote:
